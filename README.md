### Compiling

I've intentially made this a bit of a pain in the ass to compile since I am tired of people taking credit for work wihtout proper citing/attribution. So...

1. In the swift-source directory: download and install the Swift repo.
2. Compile whatever static libraries are needed by Xcode
