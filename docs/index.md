## So, you wanna build a class-dump in 2019?

Building out an introspection tool for Apple platforms has changed considerably since the original [class-dump](http://stevenygard.com/projects/class-dump/) came out. Learning these new technologies can be qutie intimidating for the uninitiated. 

These articles aim to explain the complete process of programmatically inspecting a [Mach-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach-O) (Apple) binary by systematically going throug the following:

* Apple's [Mach-O File Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach-O)
* The symbol table (`<mach-o/nlist.h>`)
* dyld opcodes and binding
* Objective-C layout
* Swift layout
* ARM64e disk pointers

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/DerekSelander/dsdump/edit/master/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
